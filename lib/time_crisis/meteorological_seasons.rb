module TimeCrisis
  # Meteorological seasons are reckoned by temperature, with summer being
  # the hottest quarter of the year and winter the coldest quarter of the
  # year. Using this reckoning, the Roman calendar began the year and the
  # spring season on the first of March, with each season occupying three
  # months. In 1780 the Societas Meteorologica Palatina, an early
  # international organization for meteorology, defined seasons as groupings
  # of three whole months. Ever since, professional meteorologists
  # everywhere have used this definition. So, in meteorology for the
  # Northern hemisphere: spring begins on 1 March, summer on 1 June, autumn
  # on 1 September, and winter on 1 December.
